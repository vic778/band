> this API consists in creating a band which is associated with the members and different categoris. I used sterializer to associate the id of a member to a band.

The API has the following endpoints:

`GET /bands`

allows admin to create a band

`POST /bands/new`

`GET /bands/id`

`DELETE /instruments/id`
